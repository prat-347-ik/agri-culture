# Agri-Culture React Frontend

This is the client-side application for the Agri-Culture platform, built with React.
## Overview

This project provides a modern, interactive user interface for farmers and agricultural service providers. It includes features like a dynamic map, a marketplace, service enrollment forms, and user authentication.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
Node.js: Version 16.x or later is recommended. You can download it from nodejs.org.
npm (Node Package Manager): This is included with the Node.js installation.

You can verify your installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

node -v
npm -v


## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the development environment running on your machine.
1. Navigate to the Client Directory

From the main project root (agri-culture-feature-react-conversion), navigate into the React client folder:
cd Frontend/client


2. Install Dependencies
Once inside the client directory, run the following command to install all the necessary project dependencies listed in the package.json file. This may take a few minutes.
npm install


This command will create a node_modules directory containing all the libraries required for the project, such as React, React Router, and Leaflet.
3. Start the Development Server
After the installation is complete, you can start the local development server with this command:
npm start


This will launch the application in development mode and automatically open it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.
The server will automatically reload the page whenever you make changes to the source code, providing a live preview of your edits.
Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode.

npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm test: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

A brief overview of the key directories inside src/:
